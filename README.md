# Segway Robot
Control and simulate a 2-wheel mobile robot.
## Control
C/C++ code using Arduino functions to control the system, by inputting data from an IMU and motor encoders, then controlling 2x BDC motors using PWM. A PID control system has been devloped for planar motion. Planar and spatial LQR control systems are being worked on.
## Simulate
Python code using Control System, NumPy, matplotlib libraries to simulate and optimise the planar LQR control system.
